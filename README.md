# Bug Buster

*Welcome to Bug Buster! A classic rougelike turn-based game for the terminal!*

> [!NOTE]
> **NOTICE:** This game is still in early development stages and is not "playable" in any traditional sense. Or any sense at all, really.

# How to Play

> **(Insert Screenshot)**

Each Run begins completely anew, as this is a classic roguelike, and not a rougelite. There is **no XP** to be gained, **no upgrades**, and more uniquely **no loot**. At the start of the run, you choose your team, composed of 3 or less troopers (you choose squad size). Each Trooper can be one of seven classes, and has their own various options for their weapons and gear. Pick their weapons, pick their gear, and spawn into the depths of the Hive, on your quest to reach the Egg Chamber and extract with the precious **_Special Item_** (name undecided). The point of the game (besides to win) is to replay the scenario and gradually learn more about the specific details of enemies, and the random modifiers applied to them as well as the ones randomly applied to your troopers. Each run (path, environment, enemy waves, etc) is procedurally generated, and while the pool for possibilities isn't enourmous, it's still enough to make for some challenge. Through scanning and experience (experience fighting/managing, not XP), you'll gradually learn more and more until you get to the point where when you see and enemy or their attributes, you know how to counter them, and you know how to set up your team in order to properly and efficiently conquer the Hive.

Throughout the run, there will be **no loot** with the sole exception of random ammo finds, so you're stuck with what you selected in the **prep phase**.

## The Prep Phase

> **(Insert Screenshot)**

At the beginning of each run, you'll be greeted with the preparation screen. This is where you choose your troopers based on their class, picking between seven, with the option to have more than one of a particular class. After choosing the troopers and locking in your decision, you'll be taken to the loadout screen, where you'll choose your weapons and your gear. Each trooper class has it's own selection of equipment to choose from, and they all have their own stats, effect, and flaw, which should be taken into account when choosing. The amount of weapons and gear you can bring depends on the trooper's class, which dictactes the amount of respective slots they have available to fill. Some options come with tradeoffs, for example sometimes in order to carry X amount of Gear, even though the trooper's Class allows carrying that amount of gear, you have to give up one of your weapons slots or not carry any of either Primary, Secondary, or Melee Weapons.

## Important Concepts

### Traits
Traits are positive (sometimes with a minor penalty to entity stats) characteristics which provide the entity with a buff. What they all are, you'll have to discover for yourself ;)

I will tell you that the trait pools are different for Troopers & Bugs. There are also trait pools which function a little differently than the ones for entities, but which are applied to Weapons & Gear. Each piece of equipment has *one* trait, and it is not randomly chosen. For Weapons, think of it more as an "ability". For Gear, depending on which piece it is, it's either more of a trait or an ability.

Troopers each spawn with one randomly chosen trait. Bugs can spawn with multiple.

### Flaws
Flaws are negative characteristics which provide the entity with a debuff.

As with Traits, the flaw pools are different for Troopers & Bugs.

Again like Traits, Troopers spawn with one randomly chosen flaw, and Bugs can spawn with multiple. Weapons & Gear each have one flaw, not it's predetermined.

### Tactics
As opposed to the usual use of the word "Tactics" in regards to how to play a game, this instead refers to Bug attack patterns. Each Tactic also comes with either applied debuffs to the target (a trooper) or buffs to aliies (Bugs, either neighboring or of a certain Class), sometimes both.

And no, I'm not going to tell you what they all are.

### Buffs

### Debuffs

## Recommendations

- Take more than 1 trooper, unless you hate yourself.
- Keep Your Troopers alive (all of them).
- Remember to safeguard behind you as you go, because you have to go back the way you came in, and there *will* be more bugs trying to kill you.
